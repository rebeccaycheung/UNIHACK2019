# UNIHACK2019
As you're all aware, there was a world-wide climate strike last Friday in over 100 countries. Where more than 1.5 million students took part in the strike with 150, 000 from Australia alone.

These massive group of people went on strike because they feel disenfranchised and disempowered by the current society. They feel that they can't make a significant positive impact to climate change policy unless they all banded together in a concerted effort. There is a whole generation of people who are becoming more and more concious about climate change, which also includes being more selective about who they eat with or what brands they trust.

ecoEats gives power back to the invidivuals by making it easier for them to eat in a more eco-friendly manner by rewaarding them for each purchase.

We believe we all share this responsibility of being sustainable, particularly businesses, who are our primary targets. 

By establishing partnerships with cafes and restaurants, they can increase their consumer base and reputation — all by leveraging our gamified platform. They are encouraged to be sustainable, fulfil KPIs and improve their business’ image all while fulfilling their corporate social responsibilites.

This is a huge effort to support businesses already implementing sustainable practises, while also encouraging other businesses to enter this growing market.

**Why would customers want to use the app?**
- Many people feel disenfranchised that they are unable to make a significant impact with the climate change movement. That no matter how hard you try, that you aren't making a difference in the sea that is 7 billion people.
- Take the world-wide climate change strike as an example.
- But exactly like the world-wide school strike, where the young generation felt that the only way they could make a difference in the world is to all take a day out of their education to express their dissatisfaction to the people who have the power to make a change.
- **Power back to the individual**
- As we all know, there was a climate change strike (temperatures are rising each year, Arctic is almost gone)
- Making meaningful business decisions about who they buy products from
